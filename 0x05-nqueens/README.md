This code first checks the number of arguments passed to the program. If there are not exactly 2 arguments, the program prints an error message and exits. The second argument is then checked to make sure that it is an integer greater than or equal to 4. If it is not, an error message is printed and the program exits.

If the arguments are valid, the program creates a 2D array to represent the chessboard. The array is initialized to all zeros. The solve() function is then called to recursively solve the problem. The solve() function takes the chessboard and the number of queens remaining as input. If the number of queens remaining is 0, the function prints the solution and returns. Otherwise, the function loops through all the columns in the chessboard and checks if the queen can be placed in that column without being attacked by any other queen. If it can, the queen is placed in the column and the solve() function is called recursively to solve the rest of the problem. If the queen cannot be placed in the column, the function moves on to the next column.
