The Star Wars API, often referred to as the "SWAPI," is an open API (Application Programming Interface) that provides access to a vast amount of data related to the Star Wars universe. It allows developers to retrieve information about characters, planets, starships, vehicles, species, and films from the various Star Wars movies, TV shows, and related media.

The SWAPI offers a RESTful interface, meaning that you can send HTTP requests to specific endpoints to retrieve data in a structured format, usually in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This makes it easy to integrate Star Wars-related information into your own applications, websites, or projects.
