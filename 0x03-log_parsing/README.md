Log parsing involves the process of systematically analyzing and extracting relevant data from log files. The primary goal is to transform unstructured log data into structured and actionable information. It enables software engineers and system administrators to identify errors, anomalies, performance bottlenecks, security breaches, and other pattern

Tasks 0. Log parsing Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: - [] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped) After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning: Total file size: File size: where is the sum of all previous (see input format above) Number of lines by status code: possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500 if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code format: : status codes should be printed in ascending order Warning: In this sample, you will have random value - it’s normal to not have the same output as this one.
